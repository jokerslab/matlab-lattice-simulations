This project is code for matlab simulation of 3 state lattice model

Lattice Simulation of Crystallization

The model:

For an overview of the algorithm see the FlowChart

For code listing and documentation see the [code documentation here](http://matlab-lattice-simulations.googlecode.com/svn/doc/index.html).


To get started running simulations see the GettingStarted guide.

(White-Solvent, Black-Solute, Green-Crystallized Solute)

In addition, it is easy to extend the model to include additional components..this example uses water to look at drug release.
